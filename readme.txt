Hello!
This is my first Git - GitHub project: "GDP - Life Expectancy".

The relationship between GDP and Life expectancy of 6 countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA and Zimbabwe. The data cover the years from 2000 - 2015. For the analysis was used Pandas, for the visualisation was used Seaborn and Matplotlib.

We can see that is noticeable a slight corelation between GDP and Life expectancy. We can say that the outliers here are Zimbabwe in Life expectancy and USA in GDP. In all the countries there is a slight increscent of GDP, except Chine where GPD rised by 4x. 
Also the increscent of Life expectancy is stable expect the Zimbabwe, where the increscent is by 35%.
From the graphs we can see that the corelation between is visible, but we cannot take that for granted because there are many other factors that have impact on life expectancy
